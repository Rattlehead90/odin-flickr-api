This is a flickr-api app, that allows you to see last 10 photos of a person on Flickr if you enter their ID.

# What I used

The app makes use of two gems: [figaro])(https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) and [flickr-api](https://github.com/cyclotron3k/flickr). One allows you to store your API keys safely in environmental variables. The other... well, utilize Flickr API in Ruby.
